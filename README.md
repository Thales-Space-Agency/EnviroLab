# EnviroLab 🌌🌡️

## Overview 🌐
EnviroLab is an Arduino-based project designed to simulate an environmental monitoring system like those used in space exploration. It uses temperature and humidity sensors to collect data, mirroring the functionality of monitoring equipment on space stations or satellites. This project aims to demonstrate how space technology can be replicated and studied using accessible, everyday electronics.

## Features 🚀
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Using a temperature sensor to record ambient temperature.
- **Humidity Sensing**: Employing a humidity sensor to track environmental moisture levels.
- **Data Transmission**: Utilizing an Ethernet shield for data transmission to a computer for analysis.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Implementing software for real-time data capture and analysis.

## Hardware Requirements 🛠️
- Arduino Board
- Grove Shield
- Ethernet Shield
- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor

## Software Requirements 💻
- Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino

## Setup and Installation 📋
1. **Hardware Assembly**: Connect the sensors and Ethernet shield to the Arduino board following the standard connections.
2. **Software Setup**: Program the Arduino with the provided code to read and transmit sensor data.
